<h1>Exercise 3: Data of Interest for Current and Future Projects</h1>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you will identify and describe the types of data that are essential or interesting for both your ongoing and planned research projects. You
    will evaluate the availability, format, collection method, and expected size of these datasets.</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<div class="step"><strong>Step 1 (5 min):</strong>
    <p>List one current research project and one potential future project you are considering. For each, briefly describe the overall research goal in 2–3
        sentences.</p></div>
<div class="step"><strong>Step 2 (10 min):</strong>
    <p>For each project, outline the key datasets you require or find valuable. For each dataset, record:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data content</strong> – What is the dataset expected to include?</li>
        <li><strong>Availability</strong> – Is it freely available, behind a paywall, or privately held?</li>
        <li><strong>Format</strong> – In which format(s) is the data available (e.g., CSV, JSON, SQL database, PDF, images)?</li>
        <li><strong>Access method</strong> – How could you obtain it (manual collection, API access, web scraping, digitization)?</li>
        <li><strong>Size</strong> – Estimated number of records or file size.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="step"><strong>Step 3 (15 min):</strong>
    <p>In groups. Present your dataset lists to each other. Discuss:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Which datasets are most immediately obtainable and which might require significant effort?</li>
        <li>Possible alternative data sources or strategies if your preferred source is not available.</li>
        <li>Whether combining datasets from multiple sources could benefit your research.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<h2>Expected Outcome</h2>
<p>By the end of this exercise, you will have an overview of the datasets relevant to your current and future projects, including details about
    their content, availability, format, and acquisition method. You will also have considered feasibility, potential barriers, and alternative sources.</p>
