<h1>Exercise 3: UNIX Data Triage â€” Identify Files, Detect Errors, Explore Data</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
  In this exercise, you will identify the advantages and disadvantages of using the command line and how to learn how to use it for data triage.
</p>

<p>
  Feel free to open a command line, if you have access to one.
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<div class="step"><strong>Step 1 (15 min): War stories</strong>

  <p>
    In this exercise, you will discuss among your group the advantages and disadvantages of using the command line and you experiences with the command line or GUI programs in relation to the problems laid out in the live coding session.
  </p>

  <p>
    Discuss the following issues:
    <ul>
      <li>Experience with unknown file formats, and <em>how they were overcome</em></li>
      <li>Experience with character encodings, and <em>how they were overcome</em></li>
      <li>Experience with broken files and file formats, and <em>how they were overcome</em></li>
      <li>Experience with similiar problems and <em>how they were overcome</em></li>
    </ul>
  </p>


  <div class="step"><strong>Step 2 (10 min): Next steps</strong>

  <p>
    Were there things in the live session, that did not make sense or was trivial?
  </p>

  <p>
    Discuss how to proceed in becoming familiar with the command line. Where could you go to find information, tutorials, help?
    <ul>
      <li>If on a Mac</li>
      <li>If on a Windows PC</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
</div>

  <div class="step"><strong>Step 3 (5 min): Do you think, you will ever use the command line?</strong>
    <p>
      If not, why? <code>;-)</code>
    </p>
  </div>
  
<h2>Expected Outcome</h2>
  <p>
    you should now have a beginning of an idea of what the command line might be capable of and a beginning understanding of files.
  </p>

  <p>
    You should also have an idea of where and how to take the next steps.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also, remember, no matter how fancy or expensive a GUI is, it's all just files with bytes on a "harddisk" (your own computer or maybe a computer owned by someone else (a.k.a. The Cloud). The command line brings decades old tools to your tool chest. Tools, that have been tried and tested through literally more than half a century.
