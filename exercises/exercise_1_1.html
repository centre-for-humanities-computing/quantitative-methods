<h1>Exercise 1: Quantitative Alignment</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you will explicitly connect your research interests and questions with suitable quantitative methods, facilitating clearer alignment
    between your research objectives and computational techniques.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<div class="step">
    <strong>Step 1 (5 min):</strong>
    <p>Write a brief description (3–5 sentences) clearly stating your central research interest or primary research question.</p>
</div>

<div class="step">
    <strong>Step 2 (10 min):</strong>
    <p>Individually reflect on and suggest quantitative or computational methods (e.g., topic modeling, sentiment classification, network analysis) that could
        address or illuminate your research interest. If you are unsure about specific methods, clearly articulate the insights or data you hope to gain through
        quantification. During this step, instructors will circulate to provide guidance and support.</p>
</div>

<div class="step">
    <strong>Step 3 (15 min):</strong>
    <p>Form small groups of 2–3 participants. Each member should briefly present their research interest and proposed quantitative methods. Provide and receive
        constructive feedback, considering alternative methodological suggestions from your peers.</p>
</div>

<h2>Expected Outcome</h2>
<p>By the end of this exercise, you will have established a clear and documented alignment between your research interests and relevant quantitative methods,
    strengthened by instructor guidance and peer feedback.</p>
