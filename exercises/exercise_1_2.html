<h1>Exercise 2: Case Study Application</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Apply insights from the presented case study to your own research, exploring practical uses of computational and quantitative methods.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<div class="step">
    <strong>Step 1 (5 min):</strong>
    <p>Review your earlier research description and the quantitative methods you identified in Exercise 1.</p>
</div>

<div class="step">
    <strong>Step 2 (10 min):</strong>
    <p>Reflect on how the approaches and outcomes demonstrated in the case study presented by Mia Jacobsen apply to or inform your own research.</p>
</div>

<div class="step">
    <strong>Step 3 (20 min):</strong>
    <p>In groups of 2-3, discuss specific ways the case study methods can practically inform or enhance your research projects. Provide mutual feedback on practical implementation and potential challenges.</p>
</div>
